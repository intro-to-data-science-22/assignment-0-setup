### Task 1 - Dealing with a numeric vector


Consider the following numeric vector.

```{r}
x <- c(34, 56, 55, 87, NA, 4, 77, NA, 21, NA, 39)
```

a)  What's the mean of all values? And what's the median?

```{r}

```

b) What's the variance and the standard deviation of all values?

```{r}

```

c) Compute the sum of all values in the vector `x`.

```{r}

```

d) Create a new vector, `x_std`, that standardizes `x`, i.e. transforms the values in a way that `mean(x_std) = 0` and `sd(x_std) = 1`.

```{r}

```

### Task 2 - Dealing with a character vector

Consider the following character vector.

```{r}
friends <- c("Homer", "Marge", "Bart", "Lisa", "Maggie")
```


a) Get the length of the vector.

```{r}

```

b) Extract the first two elements of the vector.

```{r}

```

c) Extract the second and the last observation from the vector.

```{r}

```

d) Sort the elements in reverse alphabetic order.

```{r}

```

### Task 3 - A dataset on immigration trips to Ellis Island

a) Load the dataset `immigration-ellis.tsv` into R, which contains data on immigration to Ellis Island (1918-1922) by trip.

```{r}

```

b) What is the total number of immigration cases in the dataset?

```{r}

```

c) From where did the ship with the most immigrants arrive?

```{r}

```

d) How many unique ships (according to the name) are in the dataset?

```{r}

```

e) Find out the name of the package from the tidyverse that makes working with date and times data easier, and report it below!

<div class = "answer"> 
YOU PUT YOUR TEXT HERE

Also, you will notice that the text you put inside here will not appear in your .html file.
That is because very similar to the # in our R scripts, this is a comment tag for html.
